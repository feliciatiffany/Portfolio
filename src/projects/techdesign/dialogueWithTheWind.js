    "“Dialogue with the Wind” is an interactive installation that invites self-reflection through a responsive field of fiber-optic grass. " +
    "Participants speak honestly into the space; the installation responds through shifting color, ambient flow, and sound—turning private emotions into a gentle, sensory dialogue.",
