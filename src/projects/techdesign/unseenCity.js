    intro:
        "This project investigates how cities are shaped by overlapping layers—people, biomes, weather systems, infrastructure, and digital traces that are both visible and invisible. Inspired by Mark Graham’s idea of the city as a palimpsest, it treats urban experience as something continually rewritten, yet still marked by older data, images, maps, narratives, and histories.\n\n" +
        "To “unravel” these layers, I selected a Site of Interest and conducted field research by collecting grounded “data points” through observation and documentation. I translated these findings into a set of creative outputs—experience visualization, narrative storytelling, and a site data document—capturing the phenomenological feel of the place while revealing the hidden structures that shape how it is lived and perceived.",

A city is not only a stack of buildings, people, ecosystems, and transit links, but a gathering of stories from millions of main characters and points of view. Each day is a good day or a bad day for someone. It reminds us that what appears as data is, at times, someone’s life.",
            "The weave of observed data and lived interaction opens a new way of seeing for anyone, and for me from my bedroom window. The mix and connectedness of things—from the state of the sidewalk, the neighbor across the window, the weather, the air, the intersubjectivity of the surroundings, down to something as simple as a bird alighting—can offer a fresh view of a place I see every day. It teaches the skill of seeing, and seeing what is unseen.",
